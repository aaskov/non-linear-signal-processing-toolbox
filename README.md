nsp (Non-linear signal processing)
=========
Sandbox for non-linear signal processing in Python (2.7) written for a better understanding of the complex methods. All materiel and syntax is inspired by the work of Lars Kai Hansen DTU for the 02657 non-linear signal processing course.

### About the project
Based on the Numpy package for Python. Still in development.

### Requirements
 - [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), Scientific computing with Python.
 - [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), A 2D plotting library.

### Example Gaussian Process (GP)
This is a timeseries prediction example using a Gaussian Process.
